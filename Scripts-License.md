All DebianDog project scripts are result from community work and contributions in [Puppy linux forum](http://murga-linux.com/puppy). Most don't have a license included but license [GPL-v3](https://github.com/DebianDog/Wheezy/blob/master/LICENSE) applies to all. No warranty of any kind.

We can't identify with sure all people who should get credits for the included code so feel free to write me an e-mail in case you see parts of your code here without source link and I will update the information. Same goes for contributors who want to apply different license to some contribution. Feel free to contact me and I will try to fix this.

DebianDog, MintPup, XenialDog iso images could include packages with different licenses. Read the license documentation about some script or deb package for more information.
