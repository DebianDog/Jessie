Description: Porteus-boot helper-scripts (Note: works only on DebianDog)
 This version has included the scripts for the new-save-setup
 Note: Removing this package does not make any change.
 This is on purpose because the scrips are essential for porteus-boot to work
 To revert back to the old save-setup, install version 0.0.2
