Skype for Linux 4.3 README

INSTALLATION
============

If you are using one of the distribution-specific packages, simply run the
"skype" executable.  KDE users should find a launcher for Skype in their
Internet menu if Skype has been installed through one of these packages.

If you are using the dynamic and statically linked generic versions, you
will need to choose a path for Skype to exist in.  We recommend copying the
Skype binary to /usr/bin and installing sounds/, lang/ and avatars/ into
the /usr/share/skype directory.

KNOWN ISSUES
============

General

  * On Debian 6.0 64-bit version, Skype crashes on startup with the message: 
    "Inconsistency detected by ld.so: dl-open.c: 623: _dl_open: Assertion 
    `_dl_debug_initialize (0, args.nsid)->r_state == RT_CONSISTENT' failed!"
    This seems to be Debian only issue with 32 bit PulseAudio libraries being 
    installed even if PulseAudio is not active, a workaround can be:
    - Debian Squeeze:
      sudo chmod a-r /usr/lib32/libpulse{-simple.so.0.0.3,.so.0.12.2,common-0.9.21.so}

  * On some 64-bit distributions avatars are not showing, this is a problem 
    with 32-bit emulation Qt library. Qt tries to find its image format 
    plugins but finds a 64-bit version instead and fails to load it.
    A workaround is to specify a plugin path when launching Skype like this:
    - Ubuntu 64 bit: install "ia32-libs" package and launch Skype with: 
      QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/usr/lib32/qt4/plugins skype
    - Arch 64 bit (with 32 bit chroot installed in /opt/arch32): 
      QT_PLUGIN_PATH=/opt/arch32/usr/lib/qt/plugins skype
    - Other distributions might have a different path.

  * Ubuntu/Unity users that upgraded from older versions might experience
    missing Skype icon in the Tray, a workaround can be:
      sudo apt-get install dconf-tools
      dconf-editor
    Expand "desktop->unity->panel" and add the following to the
    "systray-whitelist" item: 'Skype', 'skype'
    Finally logout and login again from Unity.

  * If the Skype icon still does not appear in the Tray, a workaround can be:
      sudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386

  * Kubuntu 12.04+ 64-bit users may have trouble installing the DEB package,
    this is because the Kubuntu's default DEB manager is not able to 
    handle correctly multiarch support.
    To workaround this you need to install a better one:
    - from a console type:
      sudo apt-get install qapt-deb-installer
    - right click on the Skype DEB package -> Open With -> Other...
    - type:
      /usr/bin/qapt-deb-installer
    - click on OK
    - proceed with the installation from the new window.

  * Debian 7.x 64-bit users may have trouble installing the DEB package,
    from the root user run the following commands:
      dpkg --add-architecture i386
      apt-get update
    Now proceed with the installation of the DEB package.

Accessibility

  * In order to have Screen Reader support on incoming notifications you need
    the 'notify-send' binary in your path:
    - Debian (from the root user)
      apt-get install libnotify-bin
    - Ubuntu
      sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

  * Ubuntu and Debian 64-bit users may experience no screen reader support,
    due to the lack of the 32-bit plugin, a workaround can be:
    - Debian 7.x 64-bit (from the root user)
      apt-get install qt-at-spi:i386
    - Ubuntu 12.04+
      sudo apt-get install qt-at-spi:i386
    Ubuntu 13.10+ users may also need to reboot the OS after that.

  * Ubuntu and Debian 64-bit users may experience no High Contrast nor style support,
    a workaround can be:
    - Debian 7.x 64-bit (from the root user)
      apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 gtk2-engines:i386 libgconf-2-4:i386
    - Ubuntu 12.04+ 64-bit
      sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0:i386 gtk2-engines:i386 libgconf-2-4:i386

  * How to navigate Skype for Linux using only the keyboard:
      Tab             Moves the current focus from one element to another.
      Space           Selects any push button.
      Return          Selects a chat or call from history or missed events, 
                      and selects an option from a drop down list.
      Up/Down arrow   Moves through contacts, history/missed events, radio boxes 
                      and combo box selection.
    All the other hotkeys are listed at the end of this file.

  * Orca Screen Reader Key Bindings
    Orca provides two keyboard modes: "desktop" and "laptop" keyboard layout.
    The 'Orca_Modifier' key is 'Insert' in "desktop" keyboard layout and 
    'Caps_Lock' in "laptop" keyboard layout.
      Orca_Modifier + Space    Displays the preferences configuration dialog
      Orca_Modifier + Return   Performs the basic "Where am I" operation
      Tip: Apply this key binding when wanting to listen to previous Skype chat messages.

Audio

  * Ubuntu users might have problems in PulseAudio recognition.
    Please run the following command to fix this issue:
      sudo apt-get install libasound2-plugins:i386

  * Alsa users with no PulseAudio installed/running will have no audio devices.
    Alsa support has been disabled from Skype for Linux, please install and run
    PulseAudio.

Chats

  * Selections behaviour is unpredictable in right-to-left languages.
  * Fedora users may have issues with special characters like accented letters 
    or with Asian languages; a possible workaround may be to run the following 
    command line:
      sudo yum install ibus-qt.i686

File Transfers

  * When sending a file to a contact, even after is correctly sent, stays
    in 'Waiting' state.
    This is a feature and not a bug, sending files now is possible to all
    recipients' instances (desktop, mobile, etc) and you can also send files
    to yourself if you are signed-in on multiple Skype instances, please uncheck:
    Options -> Advanced -> Hide files I've sent on other devices.

  * There is currently no File Overwrite confirmation dialog.
    - Files will be automatically renamed currently to avoid overwriting.

  * On Ubuntu 12.04, when 'qt-at-spi' package is installed, causes
    Skype to crash when trying to send files.
    Please uninstall that package to solve the issue, however you'll
    loose accessibility functionality, like support for screen readers.

Options Dialog

  * When PulseAudio is enabled in the audio settings, only that specific entry
    will be available; to change the settings, use the PulseAudio manager 
    tool that is bundled with your distribution.

Video

  * If your camera capture is showing a green, scrambled or black image,
    this workaround may help:
    - Under Ubuntu's command line:
      sudo apt-get install libv4l-0:i386
      LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libv4l/v4l2convert.so skype
    - Other distributions might have the same library, but may have a 
      different path.

  * Webcam problems when trying to send video from a Logitech camera and/or 
    the error message 'Failed to query UVC control' in the console and syslog.

    for the suggested fix.
