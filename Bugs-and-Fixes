**List of DebianDog-Jessie fixes found after 04.09.2015:**

**1.** Installing and running **rythmbox** (and maybe similar packages) could fail with message like:
```
 GLib-GIO-ERROR : Settings schema 'org.gtk.Settings.FileChooser
```
The problem is in some schemas from Wheezy included in gnome-mplayer-1.0.7 package. More information read [here.](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=863936#863936) To fix this download [gnome-mplayer-fix.zip](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?mode=attach&id=90533) and extract the archive in /opt/bin (or /usr/bin). Typing this is enough to fix the problem in your running system:
```
sudo gnome-mplayer-fix
```
Or you can upgrade fixed gnome-mplayer-1.0.7 deb with:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install gnome-mplayer-1.0.7

**2.** Fixes for frugal installer from Fred described [here.](http://murga-linux.com/puppy/viewtopic.php?p=867572#867572) Upgrade the installer package with:
